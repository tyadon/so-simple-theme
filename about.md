I am currently a second-year computer engineering student at RIT in Rochester, NY. I have a passion for great design, mobile technology, and exceptional user experience. I enjoy rock climbing, the outdoors, and The Black Keys. My hometown will always be Nashville, TN. 

My weapons of choice are Vim and Xcode 5. I speak fluent Java, Objective-C, Python, and I can carry a conversation in VHDL.


My resume is available [here.](http://treyyadon.com/Resume.pdf)
