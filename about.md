I am currently a second-year computer engineering student at RIT in Rochester, NY. I have a passion for great design, mobile technology, and exceptional user experience. I enjoy rock climbing, the outdoors, and The Black Keys. My hometown will always be Nashville, TN. My resume is also available [here.](http://treyyadon.com/Resume.pdf)

My weapons of choice are Sublime Text 2, Xcode 5, and Mou. I speak fluent Java, Objective-C, Python, and I can carry a conversation in VHDL.
